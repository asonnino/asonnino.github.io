- Safety attacks detections for BFT consensus
- Privacy-preserving reputation-based systems
- Privacy-preserving and decentralised contact discovery mechanisms
- Privacy-preserving single-sign on schemes
- Dynamic parameters optimisation of consensus protocols
- Horizontally scaling DAG-based BFT consensus protocols
- Systematisation and improvements of blockchain indexers and scanners
